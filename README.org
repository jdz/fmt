* LV.JONIS.FMT

A package with utility functions to be used with tilde slash FORMAT operation.

* Basic usage

Since there already was an ~fmt~ library in Quicklisp I had to use a more
verbose package name (which is a good idea, anyway).  But when using this
library (and in examples below) I add a package-local nickname ~fmt~:

#+name: demo
#+begin_src lisp :results output
  (defpackage #:demo
    (:use #:common-lisp)
    (:local-nicknames (#:fmt #:lv.jonis.fmt)))

  (in-package #:demo)

  (format t "~@/fmt:ts/~%" (encode-universal-time 33 22 11 12 5 1994))
  (format t "~/fmt:nbytes/B~%" most-positive-fixnum)
  (format t "~/fmt:bytes/~%" (map 'vector #'char-code "Hello, world!"))
#+end_src

The output is:

#+RESULTS: demo
: 1994-05-12T11:22:33
: 4.0EB
: 48656C6C6F2C20776F726C6421

More examples and expected results can be found in [[file:tests/fmt.lisp]].
